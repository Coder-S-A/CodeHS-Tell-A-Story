        <h1>Biggest cause of Global Warming</h1>
		<p>
		    A major cause of global warming is greenhouse gases such as 
		    water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane. You might be thinking 
		    "we've always had greenhouse gasses; why is global warming important
		    now?" The answer to this question is that over the last century, the
		    burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the 
		    concentration of carbon dioxide. This happens because the coal or 
		    oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make 
		    carbon dioxide.
