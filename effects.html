        <h1>Effects of Global Warming</h1>
        <p>
		    Some effects of global warming that scientists hav been predicting 
		    for a while that are now happening are loss of sea ice, accelerated 
		    sea level rise, and longer, more intense heat waves. Some future 
		    effects are that temperatures will continue to rise, frost-free 
		    season (and growing season) will lengthen, there will be more 
		    droughts and heat waves, and many more.
