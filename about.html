        <h1>What Global Warming is</h1>
        <p>
		    Global warming is the increasing temperatures in our world. Over the 
		    past 50 years, the average global temperature has increased at the 
		    fastest rate in recorded history. And experts see the trend is 
		    accelerating: One of the 16 hottest years in NASA’s 134-year record 
		    have occurred since 2000. Climate change deniers have argued that 
		    there has been a “pause” or a “slowdown” in rising global 
		    temperatures, but several recent studies, including a 2015 paper 
		    published in the journal Science, have disproved this claim. On top 
		    of this, scientists say that unless we curb global-warming 
		    emissions, average U.S. temperatures could increase by up to 10 
		    degrees Fahrenheit over the next century.
